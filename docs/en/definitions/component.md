# Description of User Interface Modeling Elements - Component

## Component

The component represents an element of the system that handles the user interface. It is an independent entity that can exists in multiple instances. It can be triggered by user activity or as a result of context-generated events independently of the user.

In the model, the component is represented by:

![Component](../../img/ui-component.png)

or:

![Component](../../img/ui-component-name.png)

`Component ID` identifies the component and can be used as a name in the source code prepared by developers.

The component may contain panels or basic user interface elements.
